There have been several requests over the years for the other addons I have to be able to share their configuration across different installations. For example, PinSentry - to set up the configuration once, AudioBooks - to share the position listened to etc etc.

So to support this I have created a new service Addon: "AddonSync". This addon allows you to set one of your Kodi installations as the "Master" and have all the other installations be Slaves. Then you can have the master installation upload to a network share, and the slave installation download them.

Please feel free to post any comments.
